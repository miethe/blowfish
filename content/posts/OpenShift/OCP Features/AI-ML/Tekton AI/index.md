## Synopsis

In this post, we delve into the application of Tekton, a powerful Kubernetes-native continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution, for managing AI workloads on an OpenShift cluster. We'll discuss the advantages of Tekton for AI/ML workflows and provide detailed examples and configurations.

## Introduction

Tekton introduces a cloud-native mechanism to define and run CI/CD pipelines, making it a fitting tool for managing AI/ML workloads. From automating model training to deploying models into production, Tekton can streamline your AI/ML workflows on OpenShift.

## Tekton Overview

Tekton provides Kubernetes custom resources to define pipelines, tasks, and runs. A `Task` is a collection of steps that perform a specific job, like training a model or deploying an application. A `Pipeline` groups multiple tasks together, and a `PipelineRun` is an execution of a pipeline.

## Tekton for AI/ML Workflows

Let's examine how Tekton can streamline AI/ML workflows on OpenShift, with specific examples.

### 1. Automating Model Training

You can define a Tekton task to automate the model training process. This task might include steps to pull the training data from a data source, run the training job, and save the trained model to a model registry. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: train-model
spec:
  steps:
  - name: pull-data
    image: <your-data-image>
    script: |
      # Pull data from your data source
  - name: train
    image: <your-training-image>
    script: |
      # Run training job
  - name: save-model
    image: <your-model-image>
    script: |
      # Save model to model registry
```

### 2. Deploying Models

A Tekton task can also handle model deployment. This task might include steps to pull the trained model from the model registry, create a SeldonDeployment or a KFServing InferenceService to serve the model, and expose a service to access the model.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: deploy-model
spec:
  steps:
  - name: pull-model
    image: <your-model-image>
    script: |
      # Pull model from model registry
  - name: deploy
    image: <your-deployment-image>
    script: |
      # Deploy model using Seldon or KFServing
  - name: expose-service
    image: <your-service-image>
    script: |
      # Expose service to access the model
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline for AI/ML

You can orchestrate these tasks into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the entire AI/ML workflow. The pipeline can be triggered by events such as a new data arrival or a code update, enabling continuous integration and deployment of your AI/ML workloads.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: ai-pipeline
spec:
  tasks:
  - name: train-model
    taskRef:
      name: train-model
  - name:

 deploy-model
    taskRef:
      name: deploy-model
    runAfter:
    - train-model
```

## Conclusion

Tekton presents a powerful tool for managing AI workloads in an OpenShift cluster. By automating and streamlining AI/ML workflows, Tekton ensures faster, more reliable, and repeatable processes. This ultimately leads to a more efficient and agile machine learning lifecycle.
