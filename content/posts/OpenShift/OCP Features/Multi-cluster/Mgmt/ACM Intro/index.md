## The Hybrid Cloud Push

The concept of **hybrid cloud** has been a game-changer. By allowing organizations to run applications in the environment that suits them best - whether that's public cloud, private cloud, or on-premise - they can achieve the best of all worlds. Additionally, when the tools used support this model, enterprises are able to reduce vendor lock-in, no longer being held hostage by their cloud or hardware vendors.

For a variety of reasons, be it regulatory compliance, cost optimization, latency considerations, redundancy and disaster recovery, or even flexibility, the hybrid cloud model has emerged as the preferred choice for many organizations. And with this shift, multi-cluster management, and consequently **ACM**, have found themselves in the spotlight.

## Advanced Cluster Management (ACM): The Foundation

**Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management**, or *ACM*, as the name implies, is all about taking control of multiple Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters. These could span across different cloud vendors or a mix of on-premise and cloud infrastructures, thereby setting the stage for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. **ACM** provides a centralized control plane that makes managing these multiple clusters a lot more streamlined and less prone to error.

But **ACM** is more than just a management layer for multiple clusters via a single-pane-of-glass. It also extends the capabilities of OCP across the Hybrid Cloud, enabling the deployment and management of applications and infrastructure, and standardizing the enforcement of policies and security.

Like most of Red Hat's products, OpenShift Container Platform's (OCP) **ACM** is actually based on an open-source project, the **Open Cluster Management** (*OCM*) project. The **OCM** project, under the stewardship of Red Hat and IBM, continues to push boundaries in the realm of multi-cluster management. Additionally, the full power of **ACM** stems from the host of integrations that it utilizes and enables.

## ACM in OpenShift's Hybrid Cloud Strategy

**ACM** is not just a handy feature of OpenShift; it's a linchpin in Red Hat's and IBM's hybrid cloud strategy. As mentioned above, it's about more than just managing clusters; it's about policy-based governance, automated application deployments, and robust security features.

As these organizations continue their steadfast commitment to the hybrid cloud strategy, ACM serves as the key orchestrator in ensuring that applications are effectively deployed, managed, and secured across diverse environments.

## The Capabilities of ACM

Let's take a closer look at some of the powerful capabilities ACM brings to the table.

### Hybrid and Multi-cloud Capabilities

One of **ACM**'s standout features is its ability to seamlessly manage clusters across multiple clouds and on-premise environments. This facilitates a hybrid approach to infrastructure management, where organizations can enjoy the flexibility of public clouds and the control of private clouds or on-premise environments.

### Policy-based Governance

**ACM** provides an overarching policy framework that ensures compliance across clusters. These policies can range from simple configurations to complex security regulations and can be customized to meet the specific needs of a business. This allows for the standardization of policy configuration and enforcement across *n* clusters, while managing them from a single location.

### Automated Application Deployments

**ACM** simplifies the process of deploying applications across multiple clusters. By utilizing GitOps methodologies, **ACM** can automate deployments, reduce human error, and ensure consistency. It also allows for deployments of workloads to span multiple clusters by integrating with other OCP technologies such as the OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio) and Submariner. This enables higher SLAs for target workloads by treating the deployment across multiple clusters as existing in a single network.

## Alternatives on the Market

Some of you may be reminded of competing technologies, such as those from **Rancher** and **Anthos**, when you see mention of multi-cluster management. While these do offer some of the same core cluster management capabilities as **ACM**, it is important to remember some of the key differentiators when making your choice.

### Rancher

**Rancher**, now a part of SUSE, provides a Kubernetes management platform that is renowned for its simplicity and ease of use. It supports multi-cluster management across diverse environments. Rancher's strengths include its lightweight footprint, flexibility, and a rich catalog of applications ready for deployment. Rancher is excellent for lab environments, for users with minimal scaling requirements, or that have the resources and desire to build a full platform from scratch.

> While I won't get into the weeds of this comparison today, just understand that the target markets for Rancher vs **OCP/ACM** are often VERY different!

### Anthos

**Google's Anthos** is a modern application management platform that extends Google Cloud services into on-premise and other public clouds. It offers a consistent platform for all applications, leveraging Kubernetes, service mesh, and other modern paradigms. Its strengths include deep integration with Google Cloud services, strong security, and advanced analytics capabilities. That said, its capabilities are generally considered much less mature than OpenShift's, and it becomes severely limited outside of the Google ecosystem, whereas **ACM** provides parity across all cloud-providers, and even across mixed Kubernetes distributions.

## The Future of ACM

The growing adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud environments makes the future of **ACM** a promising one. As the demands on multi-cluster management continue to grow, we can expect **ACM** to evolve, accommodating more sophisticated orchestration capabilities, enhanced security measures, and seamless integration with a wider range of cloud services.

**ACM**, in all likelihood, will play a crucial role in the unfolding chapter of the hybrid cloud era, enabling organizations to unlock unprecedented levels of operational efficiency and application portability.

## Conclusion

In the end, **Red Hat's Advanced Cluster Management** (ACM) is not merely an operational tool; it is the lifeblood of an effective hybrid cloud strategy. By providing granular control over multi-cluster environments, enforcing compliance, and facilitating automated deployments, **ACM** holds the key to harnessing the true potential of the hybrid cloud.

While **ACM**, **Rancher**, and **Anthos** all offer robust multi-cluster and hybrid cloud management capabilities, their strengths cater to different use cases. The choice between them should be guided by your organization's specific requirements, existing infrastructure investments, and future cloud strategy.

I hope this post provided valuable insights into the Hybrid Cloud world, and the vital role of ACM in the future of Platform Engineering. Stay tuned for next time, where we will dive into the technical details of ACM and set the stage for future posts showcasing its true power!
