## Kubeburbs: The DIY City

Nestled in the countryside, there's a small city called Kubeburbs, representing a DIY Kubernetes cluster. Unlike Meatyville and Tenderloin Town, Kubeburbs isn't as formally managed. Its services are simply bolted together, mirroring the manual configuration and integration often required in a DIY Kubernetes cluster. While life has been fine for the historical residents of their small town, the lack of services and standardization is starting to severely limit Kubeburbs' growth!

## The Transformation: Meatyville's Intervention

One day, the Meatyville government (ACM in OpenShift) decided to extend its management to Kubeburbs. Just as ACM provides centralized management for OpenShift clusters, the government started managing services, resources, and infrastructure in Kubeburbs.

The residents of Kubeburbs began to notice a significant change in their Quality of Life. Sure, that small town charm may have been lost. And there were processes in place to enact changes now, versus everyone having free reign to build their own. But those are the costs of progress!

Let's explore the key differences before and after the intervention.

### Before: The DIY Struggle

Before the intervention, Kubeburbs was like a DIY Kubernetes cluster. Services worked, but they were bolted together. The residents had to put in a significant amount of effort to get things done. Roads (networking) were not always smooth, and the public services (built-in services) were basic at best. The few services that existed were always a strong wind away from falling over, and there wasn't anyone dedicated to fixing it!

### After: The OpenShift Effect

After the Meatyville government stepped in, the city started to resemble an OpenShift cluster. Roads were well-maintained, public services were abundant, and everything worked seamlessly together. The government (ACM) ensured that resources were used efficiently and that the residents' needs were met promptly. The differences were like night and day.

## Conclusion: The Transformation of Kubeburbs

The story of Kubeburbs offers a vivid illustration of the difference between a DIY Kubernetes cluster and a managed OpenShift cluster. It shows how the right management - whether it's a government or ACM - can significantly improve the Quality of Life for residents or, in the world of OpenShift, the experience for developers and users.

As you explore the world of OpenShift, remember the tale of Kubeburbs. It offers a compelling argument for the value of a managed OpenShift cluster over a DIY Kubernetes setup.
