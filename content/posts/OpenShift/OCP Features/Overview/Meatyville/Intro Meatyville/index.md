## Welcome to Meatyville: A City That Never Sleeps

Welcome to Meatyville, a bustling city where life is always vibrant, and there's always something new happening. This isn't your average city, though. No, Meatyville is a unique, almost magical place where OpenShift Clusters come alive!

Here, in this grand city, Operators are deeply integrated governments, brimming with offices and agencies that keep the city functioning smoothly. Containers? They are the heartbeat of the city - its people. OpenShift's Control Plane? That makes up the infrastructure and public services of Meatyville, holding everything together. But don't just take my word for it. Let's take a closer look!

### Meet the Residents: Pods as People

In Meatyville, **Containers** - our wonderful residents - come in all shapes and sizes. Each container is an individual unit with its own set of resources, like memory and CPU, which in Meatyville we can equate to skills and abilities. Each container, together with its skills, abilities, as well as any owned tools, create a **Pod** - a Citizen. Each Pod has a distinct role to play in Meatyville as teachers, doctors, engineers, artists, and so much more. Like humans, Pods interact with each other, sometimes depending on each other to perform certain tasks. And when they are no longer needed, they gracefully retire, making space for new Pods to take their place.

### The Government: Operators

Every city has its government, and in Meatyville, these are represented by **Operators**. Operators are like the administrative bodies governing different parts of the city. They maintain the health of the city (or the application) and ensure everything runs smoothly. Operators automate the management of complex applications, just like city administrators streamline services for residents.

Each Operator in Meatyville has a set of responsibilities, similar to how different city departments have distinct roles. They ensure that the Pods (our citizens) have everything they need to live and work comfortably. In other words, Operators make sure that the applications run correctly and are updated or scaled as needed.

### The Infrastructure and Public Services: OpenShift

OpenShift's Control Plane, consisting of the Kubernetes engine and all related integrations, forms the infrastructure and public services of our vibrant city, Meatyville. It provides the underlying structure that keeps everything up and running. From roads and bridges to utilities and services, OpenShift ensures that the city can function effectively.

OpenShift manages resources for the Pods, much like a city's infrastructure supports its citizens. It keeps track of the resources and services each Container requires and ensures they're allocated appropriately, just like a city ensures its residents have access to food and shelter, as well as water, electricity, and other utilities.

## The Big Move: Deploying a Workload

Let's imagine a new family - a workload - is moving to Meatyville. The family members are the different parts of the workload, each represented by a Container. The parents might be the main application, while the kids could represent auxiliary services like databases or caching services.

When the family decides to move, the Operators - the city's administration - spring into action. They ensure the right resources are available to support the family, including housing, utilities, and public services. This is akin to the Operator ensuring that the right resources are allocated to the new Pods, so they can operate effectively.

The family settles in their new home, and the city adapts to accommodate them. The roads (networking) are updated to ensure the family can move around the city easily, and the utilities (CPU, memory) are connected to their home. The family begins interacting with other residents and the city's services, integrating themselves into the life of Meatyville.

## Conclusion: The Living City

Meatyville, our anthropomorphic OpenShift Cluster, is a living, breathing city. It is a place where Pods (people), Operators (government), and OpenShift (city infrastructure) come together to create a vibrant and dynamic environment.

The city analogy helps us understand the symbiotic relationship between the different components of an OpenShift Cluster. It provides us with a unique perspective to appreciate the intricacies involved in deploying a new workload, akin to a new family moving to the city. Perhaps in a future post, the analogy could even contrast the well-oiled machine of Meatyville (OpenShift) vs some decaying, hodgepodge neighboring city (DIY Kubernetes).

So, next time you're deploying a workload or troubleshooting an issue in your OpenShift Cluster, just imagine you're a city planner in Meatyville. It might just make the task a little more fun!
