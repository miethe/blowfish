I'm [Nick Miethe](/about), and welcome to MeatyBytes.io, a constant stream of data from my brain to yours!

On this site lives my blog, where you'll find a wealth of information on a variety of topics, depending on where my head is at on any given day.

Whether you're interested in deep dives on [OpenShift](/posts/openshift/ocp-features/), discussions on [Software/Solution Architecture](/posts/openshift/architecture/), or even *Distracted* thoughts on a [variety of hobbies](/posts), there's probably something for you here!
