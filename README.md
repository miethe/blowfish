# meatybytes

Welcome to my blog repo! If you're here, you're most likely looking for [MeatyBytes.io](https://meatybytes.io), the rendered version of the site. However, if you are interested in the backend of the site, feel free to continue on!

In short, my site is structured as followed:

* Hugo - Blog Engine, Static Site Generator: Go, JS, SCSS, HTML, Markdown
* Blowfish - Hugo theme for blogs (big fan after trying many!)
* GitHub Actions - Automated Deployment
* GitHub Pages - Hosting
* Cloudflare - Domain, DNS, Mail, etc
* BuyMeACoffe - Fuel my content!
* GA/Firebase/GSC - SEO, analytics, etc
* ahrefs - SEO, health checks, etc
